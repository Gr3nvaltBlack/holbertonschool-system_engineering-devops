## Simple Web Infrastructure

A user would like to access the website www.foobar.com via any browser.
Below, I will present a simple web infrastructure in several steps, as well as
how it processes the user's request:

1. User search
The user opens their PC, goes to their browser, and in the search bar
they send their query *www.foobar.com*.

2. DNS analysis
(Domain Name System): A computer service that associates internet domain names
with their IP addresses. When the user sends their request, a breakdown begins:
- Domain name: This is the human-readable address: *foobar.com*
- DNS record type: *www* is an A record (it links a name to an IP address)
The domain points to the IP address **8.8.8.8** (that of the server hosting the website)

3. Server (machine)
Now we move on to the server (machine) part.
The server (machine) is a special computer that runs 24/7.
This server has the IP address **8.8.8.8** and is once again the one hosting the website.

4. Web server (NGINX)
The server (machine) runs software inside the server (machine).
Its role is to receive HTTP requests and respond with content. 
This content can be static files (HTML, CSS pages) that it sends directly or
a dynamic page, then Nginx will forward the request to the application server.
    Â° Application Server
The application server is software that runs code. Its role is to execute
the business logic and then provide a response to the user.

5. Database (MySQL)
The database allows you to store and retrieve various data.
This data can be modified, changed, or completely deleted.
The application server queries the database to retrieve or update the data
as needed.

6. User's Browser
Once all processing is complete, the browser returns the request response.


SPOF (Single Point of Failure)
A point in a computer system on which the entire system depends and whose
failure would result in the complete shutdown of the system.

Impact: Users will be unable to access the website until the issue is resolved, resulting 
        in service interruption.
