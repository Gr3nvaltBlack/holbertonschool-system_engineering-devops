## Secure and monitored web infrastructure

Step-by-step explanation of a secure server

1. Added element
    Firewalls: Software used to improve the security of a local network against external intrusions.
    SSL: An internet security protocol that allows for encrypted communication and system monitoring 
        (client monitoring).

2. What are firewalls for?
    Firewalls are used to filter and control network traffic to protect the infrastructure.

3. HTTPS traffic
    This allows for encrypted communication between the client and the server,
    keeping data private and secure.

4. Monitoring
    Monitoring is used to monitor server status (CPU, memory, errors, requests) and detect problems quickly.

5. Data collection through monitoring
    Using small agents installed on each server that send metrics and logs to a central system.

6. QPS
    Configure the monitoring agent to count the number of requests processed by the web server per second.

Infrastructure Issue

1. SSL Issue
    Because traffic between the Load Balancer and the servers is no longer encrypted 
    (it travels in clear text via HTTP).

2. Issue with a single MySQL server
    This creates a SPOF; if this server fails, no more data can be written.

3. Issue with the same component
    Because this mixes roles, complicates maintenance, and can cause data inconsistencies between servers.
